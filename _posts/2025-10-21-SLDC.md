<h1 align="center">🚀 Lifecycle Mastery: SDLC for the Modern Network Developer</h1>


🔧 **Why SDLC Matters**
- Brings structure to software development.
- Avoids "cowboy coding" (unstructured, error-prone development).
- Critical for infrastructure automation and DevNet certifications (e.g., DEVASC 200-901).

===============================================================================

📌 **The Six Foundational Stages of SDLC**

1. **Planning (Requirements Analysis)**
   - Define the problem the software will solve.
   - Gather input from stakeholders, users, and domain experts.
   - Define "what success looks like".

2. **Defining**
   - Capture functional specifications in detail.
   - Define *what* the software should do — clearly and unambiguously.

3. **Designing**
   - Create architectural blueprint of the solution.
   - Get all stakeholders to agree before coding starts.

4. **Building (Coding)**
   - Convert design into actual code.
   - Usually smooth if planning/design were properly done.

5. **Testing**
   - Validate code correctness.
   - Catch bugs, defects, and check alignment with original requirements.

6. **Deployment**
   - Roll out software into production.
   - May start with limited users (pilot), then full release.
   - Evolves into continuous maintenance (updates, fixes).

📚 **Core SDLC Models You Must Know** *(as per DEVASC 200-901 Blueprint)*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. 📐 **Waterfall Model** (Linear / Sequential)

**Characteristics**:
- Fixed scope decided early.
- Each stage must complete before moving to the next.
- Value only realized at the end.

**Risks**:
- Difficult to adapt to change.
- Testing may be skipped if time runs out.
- No working product till final stage.

**Phases**: 
`Requirements → Design → Coding → Testing → Maintenance`

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. 🏭 **Lean Model** (Efficiency-First)

**Origin**: Toyota Production System (TPS)

**Core Principles**:
- 🔄 *Elimination of Waste*: Remove what doesn't add value.
- ⏱️ *Just-in-Time*: Build only when needed.
- 🔧 *Continuous Improvement (Kaizen)*: Iterate based on feedback and learning.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. 🔄 **Agile Model** (Modern Adaptive Development)

**Origin**: Agile Manifesto (2001)

**Agile = Lean + Software Focus**

**Key Principles**:
- ✅ Early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- 🔄 Embrace changing requirements — even late in the project.
- 🚀 Frequent releases (typically 2-week "sprints").
- 🤝 Daily collaboration between developers and business teams.

**Agile = Fully functional software in small chunks**
- 40% complete Agile project = 40% usable software.
- Helps businesses react and adapt quickly.

**Agile Cycle Includes**:
`Analysis → Design → Code → Test (All within a sprint)`

**Note**: Agile is a core driver behind **DevOps** and **Infrastructure as Code**.

🎯 **Summary Table: SDLC Models Comparison**

| Feature              | Waterfall                | Lean                     | Agile                    |
|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Approach             | Sequential               | Efficiency Philosophy     | Iterative + Adaptive      |
| Flexibility          | Low                      | Medium                    | High                      |
| Delivery             | End of lifecycle          | As needed                 | Continuous (Sprints)      |
| Customer Involvement | Minimal                  | Varies                    | High (Daily Collaboration)|
| Ideal for            | Fixed-scope projects     | Efficiency-driven teams   | Fast-changing environments|

===============================================================================

📘 **Recommended For**:
- DevNet Associate (DEVASC 200-901) candidates
- Infrastructure Automation Engineers
- Programmers interfacing with network systems
- Anyone shifting from traditional to programmable networks

💡 **Pro Tip**: SDLC isn’t just for developers — it’s essential for modern network engineers working in DevOps and automation.
