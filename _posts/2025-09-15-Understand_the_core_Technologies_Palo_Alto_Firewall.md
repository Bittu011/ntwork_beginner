### **Route-Based Firewall (Simple Roads & Tags)**

Think of your company’s network like a big city with different neighborhoods (subnets). In a route-based firewall:

- **Zones are just labels** (like neighborhood names).
- They don’t affect the actual traffic rules.
- They’re mostly there to help you organize the network and keep track of "which area belongs where."

👉 In short: **Zones in a route-based firewall are just markers, not decision-makers.**

---

### **Zone-Based Firewall (Traffic Police at Every Border)**

A zone-based firewall works differently. Here, zones are **very important** because the firewall actually uses them to decide what to do with traffic.

Here’s what happens step by step when data (a "packet") enters:

1. **Identify Source Zone**: The firewall checks where the packet came from (which "neighborhood").
2. **Apply Protection Rules**: If that zone has special security checks (like filtering or limiting suspicious traffic), the packet is inspected.
3. **Special Check for TCP Traffic**: If it’s a connection request (like starting a web session), it must start correctly (with a SYN signal). Otherwise, it’s blocked.
4. **Find Destination Zone**: The firewall figures out where the packet wants to go using forwarding rules or the routing table.
5. **Check NAT (Address Change)**: Sometimes the destination address is translated (like forwarding letters to a new home address). If that happens, the packet may get sent to a **different zone than originally planned.**

👉 In short: **Zones in a zone-based firewall are the main decision points for security and traffic flow.**

---

## Super Simple Analogy

- **Route-Based Firewall**: Zones are like **street names on a city map**. They help you understand the layout, but the traffic lights don’t care about the street names.
- **Zone-Based Firewall**: Zones are like **actual borders with immigration checkpoints**. Every car (or packet) is inspected depending on which border it’s crossing.

---

✅ **Key Takeaway**:

- Route-based = organizational labels, not part of the decision-making.
- Zone-based = zones play a crucial role in deciding how traffic is handled and protected.


# 🔒 Firewall Zones & Security Policy – Explained Simply

When a firewall checks traffic, it doesn’t just stop at where the traffic is coming from or going to. The **next big step** is **security policy evaluation**, and this is where the **6-Tuple** comes into action.

## 🧩 What is the 6-Tuple?

Think of it as the firewall’s checklist for matching traffic to the right security rule. The six things it looks at are:

1. **Source IP** – Where the traffic is coming from
2. **Source Port** – The “door” it left from on the source device
3. **Destination IP** – Where the traffic wants to go
4. **Destination Port** – The “door” it wants to enter on the target device
5. **Source Zone** – The network area the packet came from
6. **Protocol** – The type of communication (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP)

---

## 🗂️ What Are Zones?

- A **zone** is simply a label or container to group network interfaces.
- Each interface can only be part of **one zone**.
- Zones can be named however you like (examples: **`LAN`**, **`DMZ`**, **`Untrust`**) – pick **clear, descriptive names** to avoid confusion.
- Even if networks are physically separate (like two office buildings), they can be placed in the **same zone** if they should follow the same rules.

👉 **Best Practice:** Always use zones in your rules with a consistent naming system. It keeps things clean, avoids mistakes, and makes firewall rules much easier to read.

---

## ⚖️ How Default Zone Rules Work

Firewalls have some **built-in (implied) rules** you should know:

- **Intrazone (same zone → same zone):**
    
    ✅ Allowed by default (servers and users inside the same zone can talk to each other).
    
- **Interzone (one zone → another zone):**
    
    ❌ Blocked by default (traffic between, say, **`LAN`** and **`Untrust`**, is denied unless you allow it).
    

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters for Administrators

- You can create **rules only for inside a zone** (intrazone), **between zones** (interzone), or **for both** (universal).
- Example: You may allow all applications **within LAN** users, but not let that same rule apply to traffic from **`LAN → DMZ`**.
- If you want zones to talk to each other, you must create a **specific policy for interzone traffic**.

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Zones = groups of interfaces, make management easier.
- The firewall checks **6 things (6-Tuple)** before applying rules.
- Default rules:
    - **Same zone traffic** → Allowed
    - **Between zones** → Blocked
- Always use **clear zone names and explicit rules** to avoid security gaps.

# 🌐 Firewall Zones: How Are They Determined?

When a packet enters the firewall, one key thing the firewall must figure out is:

👉 **Which zone is this packet coming from, and which zone should it go to?**

This determination is important because security policies are applied **based on zones** (for example, LAN → DMZ, or LAN → Internet).

---

## 🛠️ How Does the Firewall Decide Zones?

- **Step 1: Source Zone** → Determined by the **interface** the packet comes in on.
- **Step 2: Destination Zone** → Determined by looking at the **routing table** or **PBF (Policy-Based Forwarding)** rules to see where the packet should go.

⚡ Order of operations:

1. **Packet In → Check Source Zone**
2. **Route or PBF Lookup → Decide Egress Interface**
3. **That Interface’s Zone = Destination Zone**
4. Later, **NAT may adjust zones**, but this happens **before security rules are applied**.

---

## 📊 Example Setup

Imagine three firewall interfaces:

- **ethernet1/1** → External (Internet) – IP: **`198.51.100.2`** – Zone: **external**
- **ethernet1/2** → DMZ – IP: **`192.168.0.1`** – Zone: **dmz**
- **ethernet1/3** → LAN – IP: **`172.16.0.1`** – Zone: **lan**

👉 Default route sends unknown traffic through **ethernet1/1** (to the internet).

---

## 🔎 Scenarios of Zone Determination

## ✅ Scenario 1: Simple Internet Access

- Source: LAN client **`172.16.0.5`** → Destination: **`1.1.1.1`**
- Lookup: Destination not inside LAN or DMZ (no direct route).
- Default route → goes out **ethernet1/1 (external)**.
- **Result:** Source zone = LAN, Destination zone = External.

---

## ✅ Scenario 2: Policy-Based Forwarding (PBF) Override

- Same source: LAN client **`172.16.0.5`** → Destination: **`1.1.1.1`**.
- But a **PBF rule** forces this traffic to **`192.168.0.25`** via **ethernet1/2**.
- **Result:** Source zone = LAN, Destination zone = DMZ.

💡 Note: PBF takes priority over the routing table.

---

## ✅ Scenario 3: Incoming Internet Traffic with NAT

- Source: Internet client **`203.0.113.1`** → Destination: Firewall’s external IP **`198.51.100.2`**.
- At first glance:
    - Source zone = External (comes in on internet interface).
    - Destination zone = External (because **`198.51.100.2`** belongs to ethernet1/1).
- BUT ➝ NAT kicks in. For example, destination NAT might send traffic inside to a **LAN server**.
- After NAT: Destination zone changes (to LAN, in this example).

---

## ⚠️ Important Reminder

- **Zone determination happens BEFORE NAT.**
- **NAT happens BEFORE security rules evaluation.**
- This sequence is key:

👉 **Zones determined → NAT applied → Security policy enforced**

---

## 📝 Key Takeaways

1. **Source zone** = where the packet entered.
2. **Destination zone** = where it’s going (decided by routing or PBF).
3. **PBF can override routing** to force traffic into a different zone.
4. **NAT can later change the perceived destination zone**, but this happens before security rules are checked.

## Understanding App-ID and Content-ID

### How App-ID gives more control

## Big picture

- **App-ID** identifies the exact application in a session regardless of port, protocol, or encryption by using signatures, protocol decoders, decryption, and heuristics to classify traffic at Layer 7.
- **Content-ID** inspects the content of allowed sessions to detect and block exploits, malware, risky URLs, and sensitive data movement, enabling single-pass, policy-driven threat prevention and data loss controls.

## Why this matters

- Modern apps and even malware commonly use TCP 80/443, so port-based rules can’t assume “web = safe,” which is why app-aware identification and inspection are essential on next‑generation firewalls.
- Combining **App-ID** for application visibility with **Content-ID** for content inspection restores granular control and reduces the attack surface while preserving sanctioned application use.

## App-ID in one glance

- App-ID is a patented Palo Alto Networks traffic classification system that identifies apps independent of port, protocol, or SSL/SSH encryption using signatures, decoders, decryption, and heuristics.
- Once identified, the policy can block, allow with threat scanning, apply data/file controls, or enforce QoS based on the application and, if desired, specific app functions.

## App-ID decision flow

1. **Initial policy match (6-tuple)**: Check source, destination, protocol, and port to quickly allow/deny baseline traffic; closing unused ports removes low‑hanging fruit early.
2. **Signature and cache check**: Apply known application signatures and the app cache to rapidly classify sessions and then recheck policy using the application context.
3. **Decryption decision**: If the flow is SSL/TLS/SSH and a decryption policy matches, decrypt and reapply signatures on the decrypted stream to identify the true app inside the tunnel.
4. **Decoder fallback window**: If still unknown after the handshake, App-ID reads up to about 4 packets or 2,000 bytes before selecting a base-protocol decoder for deeper analysis, then attempts signature matching again.
5. **Known vs unknown**: With a known protocol, decoders validate protocol behavior and may reveal a tunneled app; otherwise, the flow may be classified generically as an app like **unknown-tcp** and rematched to policy.
6. **Heuristics**: If the base protocol is unknown, heuristics/behavioral analysis help infer the protocol, after which policy is checked again with the updated context.
7. **Stop condition**: When the application is identified or the options are exhausted, App-ID stops identification processing and enforces final policy outcomes.

## Mid-session app changes

- App-ID keeps inspecting each packet in the session, so the identified application can change as more context emerges, and each change triggers an immediate policy re-evaluation.
- For example, a session may start as SSL (HTTPS), then reveal web-browsing after decryption, then identify a specific app like flickr; later, a sub-function such as flickr-uploading can be blocked even if flickr itself was allowed.

## Content-ID essentials

- Content-ID combines a real-time threat prevention engine, URL categorization, and data/file controls to detect and block exploits, malware, dangerous web access, and unauthorized file or data transfers in one pass.
- With security profiles enabled, it continuously scans allowed sessions for vulnerability exploits, viruses/worms, C2 traffic, DNS abuse, DoS patterns, malformed protocols, and data patterns matching sensitive information.

## Together, end-to-end control

- App-ID identifies “what” the traffic is, while Content-ID inspects “what’s inside,” enabling a positive security model—allow sanctioned apps and functions, inspect them, and tightly control or block everything else including unknown traffic.
- The platform is designed so App-ID decoding and Content-ID’s stream-based engine operate in parallel for low latency, with single-pass prevention to minimize performance overhead as more profiles are enabled.

## Practical policy tips

- Prefer **application-based** rules over ports and build a positive security model—explicitly allow required apps/functions and manage unknown traffic as a category per risk profile.
- Enable **decryption** (where policy and compliance permit) to reveal the true applications inside SSL/TLS and improve both App-ID accuracy and Content-ID threat prevention.
- Monitor and restrict **unknown-tcp/unknown-udp** traffic; these generic classes often indicate custom, evasive, or early-stage sessions needing closer control and logging.
- Use **function-level control** (sub‑apps) to allow base apps while blocking risky actions such as uploads, file transfer, or posting, as needed.
- Attach **URL Filtering, Vulnerability, Anti-Malware/Spyware, File Blocking, and Data patterns** security profiles to enforce Content-ID scanning consistently.
- Plan rules assuming **mid‑flow app changes** and verify logs for “Application change” events to confirm expected policy hits as context evolves.
- Keep App-ID content current so new and modified App-IDs are recognized quickly across the estate via ongoing content updates and cloud-assisted app intelligence where applicable.

## Quick glossary

- **6-tuple**: The initial match criteria—source/destination IPs and ports, protocol, and zone/policy context—that gates basic allow/deny before deep app inspection.
- **Signature**: A pattern that uniquely identifies an application or function when matched against packet payload and transaction characteristics.
- **Decoder**: A protocol-aware analyzer that validates behavior against RFCs, exposes tunneled apps, and provides context for deeper signature checks.
- **Heuristics**: Behavioral analysis used when signatures/decoders are insufficient to infer the protocol or app identity.
- **unknown-tcp/udp**: Generic classifications used when the app cannot be determined after the analysis window, which should be explicitly monitored and controlled.
- **App cache**: A fast lookup for sessions previously identified to accelerate classification in subsequent flows or packets.

## Mini lab checklist

- Create a test rule allowing web-browsing and a specific app, then add a rule to block the app’s risky sub-function (for example, uploading) to observe mid-session app changes and granular enforcement in the logs.
- Add decryption for test categories, verify that SSL turns into the true underlying apps in logs, and confirm Content-ID profiles are scanning post‑decrypt.
- Track any unknown‑tcp/udp hits and iteratively tighten policy or create custom App-IDs if they represent sanctioned internal services.

## Memory hooks

- Think “identify the app first, then inspect the content” to separate App-ID’s classification from Content-ID’s prevention role in policy design.
- Expect “SSL → web-browsing → specific app → sub‑function” transitions and ensure the rulebase handles each context change without creating unintended allow paths.

## How Content-ID makes things safe

These cover what Content‑ID scans, how it works in parallel with App‑ID, why latency stays low, and what to configure to stay safe.

## Big idea

- Content‑ID is a stream-based inspection engine that checks the content of allowed traffic for threats and data loss, while URL policy filters web access and categories in real time.
- It runs alongside App‑ID so traffic is both correctly identified (what the app is) and deeply inspected (what’s inside the flow) without adding big delays.

## What Content‑ID looks for

- Exploits and malware: vulnerability exploits, viruses, worms, spyware, and command‑and‑control (C2) indicators.
- Risky behaviors: suspicious DNS queries, DoS patterns, port scans, malformed protocols, and attempts to tunnel or evade inspection.
- Data loss: sensitive data patterns (for example, credit cards, credentials) and risky file types or transfers.

## How it stays accurate

- TCP reassembly and IP defragmentation rebuild streams and packets before inspection so packet‑level evasion tricks fail.
- Protocol validation catches malformed or non‑RFC traffic that often signals exploits, covert tunnels, or scanners.
- URL filtering policy applies alongside threat scanning to allow, block, or continue with safe‑search and category controls.

## Parallel with App‑ID

- Each packet is processed in parallel by App‑ID (to classify the application and sub‑functions) and Content‑ID (to scan the content), rather than one after the other.
- Parallelism means accurate Layer‑7 control without the “stacking latency” that comes from serial IPS chains.

## Why performance holds up

- Hardware appliances use dedicated chips/planes; virtual firewalls use dedicated processes, so additional profiles don’t multiply latency.
- Tasks are split across planes (management, control, data) to keep policy, routing, and forwarding/inspection efficient under load.

## When Content‑ID runs

- It only scans traffic that a security rule allows, and only if security profiles are attached to that rule.
- Without profiles on allow rules, traffic passes with only basic policy enforcement and no deep content inspection.

## Essential profiles to attach

- URL Filtering: category policy, safe‑search, credential phishing controls, and inline coaching/alerts.
- Anti‑Virus/Anti‑Spyware: malware and C2 detection in files and streams.
- Vulnerability Protection: exploit signatures, protocol anomaly checks, and decoder-based protections.
- DNS Security: blocks malicious domains, DNS tunneling patterns, and risky resolvers.
- File Blocking/WildFire: control file types, detonate unknowns, and block known bad hashes.
- Data Filtering: prevent sensitive data patterns and unapproved transfers.

## Practical configuration checklist

- Create a “best‑practice” profile group and attach it to all allow rules (Internet egress, DC, east‑west); avoid allow‑rules without profiles.
- Turn on SSL decryption (where policy allows) so threats and data inside TLS are visible to Content‑ID.
- Log at session end and threat events at “alert/block” to ensure forensics and tuning are possible.
- Treat unknown‑tcp/udp and unknown URL categories as high‑risk; alert or block with strict profiles until validated.

## Quick mental model

- Identify first, then inspect: App‑ID answers “what app/function is this?” while Content‑ID answers “what’s inside and is it safe?”
- Positive security model: explicitly allow known apps and categories with inspection, and control or block unknowns and risky actions.

## ASCII flow (simplified)

- Packet in → Parallel paths:
    - App‑ID: classify app/sub‑app → policy re‑check on each context change.
    - Content‑ID: reassemble/defragment → URL policy → threat/data scans → allow/block/reset/log.
- Decision combines app context + content verdict for final enforcement.

## Lab steps for quick learning

- Build two rules: allow “web‑browsing” and a specific SaaS app; then block that app’s upload sub‑function to observe mid‑session re‑evaluation.
- Attach full security profiles to the allow rule; generate benign EICAR and category tests to see URL/malware verdicts.
- Enable decryption on test categories; verify that hidden apps become visible and threats get detected inside TLS.

## Troubleshooting tips

- If traffic isn’t being scanned, check that the matching rule actually has profiles and is not shadowed by an earlier rule.
- If threats are missed on HTTPS, confirm decryption policy, certificate install, and server categories are in scope.
- For latency spikes, review SSL exceptions, large file handling, and profile actions (alert vs reset) to balance user impact.

## Memory hooks

- Parallel, not serial: low latency with deep inspection.
- Reassemble before inspect: evasion fails when streams/packets are normalized.
- No profiles on allow = no protection: always attach profile groups to allowed traffic.

## The management and data plane

## Big idea

- Modern NGFWs split work between a **management plane** for configuration/control and a **data plane** for forwarding and inspection, preventing admin tasks from disrupting traffic processing during load or maintenance.
- This separation underpins single-pass, parallel inspection, so advanced features (App-ID, Content-ID, decryption, NAT, QoS) run at high throughput with low latency on dedicated resources.

## Management plane

- The management plane runs administrative services: web/CLI configuration, logging/reporting, block pages/portals, cloud lookups, and update distribution to the data plane for signatures and content.
- It hosts control-plane processes such as dynamic routing daemons (for example, OSPF/BGP), authentication, and User-ID services, keeping control logic separate from fast-path forwarding.

## Data plane

- The data plane processes live traffic flows and enforces security: App-ID, Content-ID, policy match, session handling, NAT, QoS, and protocol lookups (ARP/MAC/route) to forward at wire speed.
- It performs decryption, file/stream analysis, and VPN data handling, often with hardware offload and protocol decoders so multiple security scans happen in parallel on each packet.

## Platform scale

- All models have a management plane, while larger appliances add multiple data planes or line cards to scale throughput; for example, PA-5200 has multiple data planes and chassis systems can host line cards with multiple data-plane equivalents per card.
- Entry platforms (for example, PA‑220) use a single board that virtually partitions CPU cores to separate management and data-plane duties without requiring separate physical blades.

## Plane communication

- A high-speed switch fabric connects planes so the data plane can request lookups or policy/context from management, and management can push config or content updates down to the data plane.
- This fabric and process isolation allow the management plane to stay responsive for troubleshooting even when data interfaces are saturated or under attack, aiding rapid response.

## Identity-based policy

- The platform can map IPs to identities/groups via User-ID, enabling policy that targets users, roles, or groups in addition to applications and services for precise, least-privilege control.
- Identity context is evaluated along with App-ID and URL categories on the data plane, allowing different actions per user or group within the same application flow.

## Performance architecture

- Single Pass Parallel Processing (SP3) means classification and threat/content scans occur once per packet/stream and in parallel, avoiding serial slowdowns as features are enabled.
- Dedicated processors/cores and offload engines in the data plane keep latency low while the management plane independently handles commits, logging, and routing control logic.

## Operations checklist

- Keep profiles, App-ID/Content updates, and firmware current on the management plane so the data plane gets timely signatures and optimizations without blocking traffic flow.
- Monitor management and data-plane health/telemetry/logs to spot capacity or process issues early; their metrics and logs are collected separately to preserve visibility during incidents.

## Quick comparisons

| **Aspect** | **Management plane** | **Data plane** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary role | Admin/control: config, logging, updates, routing daemons, identity services  | Fast-path: session handling, policy, App-ID/Content-ID, forwarding/NAT/QoS, crypto |
| Impact domain | Does not forward user traffic; safe to work on during data-plane load | Processes user traffic at wire speed with parallel security features |
| Scale model | Always present; centralizes control and updates  | Scales via multiple data planes and line cards on larger chassis  |

## Lab steps

- Observe plane separation: run heavy reporting or a commit on the management plane and verify that existing data-plane traffic remains unaffected using interface/session counters.
- Trace control vs forwarding: enable a routing protocol and confirm neighbor formation on the management/control process while inspecting route installation and forwarding on the data plane.

## Troubleshooting tips

- If the GUI/CLI is slow or unreachable but traffic flows, isolate a management-plane issue and restart only management services to avoid disrupting data-plane traffic.
- If forwarding is impacted, inspect data-plane session tables, offload utilization, and SP3 feature status while confirming that management-plane commits and updates are not the bottleneck.

## Memory hooks

- Separate brains and muscles: management = control/brains, data = packet processing/muscles, connected by a high-speed fabric.
- Parallel, not serial: single-pass architecture keeps latency flat even as features stack, thanks to dedicated data-plane resources.

## Authenticating users with User-ID

## Big idea

- User-ID links IP addresses to real user identities and groups so security policy, logging, and reports are based on people and roles—not just IPs.
- This enables precise allow/deny rules (per user or group), granular app controls, and richer investigations and audits.

## What User-ID enables

- Identity-based access: allow only specific users/groups to sensitive apps, URLs, and services.
- Fine-grained controls: different actions for different roles within the same app (for example, HR allowed uploads, interns read-only).
- Better visibility: logs, ACC, and reports show usernames and groups, simplifying forensics and compliance.

## Identification methods

- Server monitoring: read login events from Microsoft Active Directory, Microsoft Exchange, or Novell eDirectory to map user ↔ IP automatically.
- X-Forwarded-For (XFF): learn the original client IP/username from a downstream proxy that inserts XFF headers.
- Client probing: NetBIOS/WMI probes to discover logged-in users on Windows hosts in trusted segments.
- Direct authentication:
    - Captive Portal prompts or transparently authenticates users (for example, Kerberos) when identity is unknown.
    - GlobalProtect VPN provides authenticated user and host context as users connect.
- Multiuser IP mapping: Terminal Server/Citrix port mapping to distinguish multiple users behind one source IP.
- XML API: push user ↔ IP mappings from external systems or custom workflows.
- Syslog listening: parse logs from external auth systems (for example, Wi‑Fi controllers, NAC, proxies) to create user ↔ IP mappings.

## How it works end to end

- Learn identity signals from one or more sources (server logs, GP, syslog, etc.) and map them to IPs with timestamps.
- Store and age mappings; refresh on new events and expire stale entries to avoid incorrect policy hits.
- Use identity context in policy evaluation alongside App-ID, URL categories, and other match criteria.

## Policy use cases

- Internet egress: different URL categories for employees vs. contractors; restrict risky categories for interns.
- App control: allow SaaS access to finance group; block uploads for everyone else; permit admins advanced functions.
- East-west: allow RDP/SSH only to the ops group; deny lateral movement for others.

## Quick lab setup

- Enable User-ID on the inside/trusted zone where clients reside.
- Configure server monitoring to AD (read-only account) to pull logon events; commit and verify mappings.
- Add a Captive Portal rule as fallback for unknown users; test a browser redirect and Kerberos SSO if available.
- Create a security rule that matches a specific user/group; verify hits and logs show the username.
- Validate with a CLI or GUI mapping command and test access before/after user/group changes.

## Method selection tips

- Prefer server-based signals (AD/Exchange/eDirectory), GlobalProtect, and syslog from authoritative sources for accuracy and low noise.
- Use Captive Portal as a safety net when passive methods fail; keep the scope targeted to avoid user friction.
- Limit client probing (NetBIOS/WMI) to trusted, on-prem segments where it’s reliable and acceptable; avoid across WAN/VPN.
- Always enable Terminal Server/Citrix port mapping where multiple users share one IP, or use the platform’s agent/feature for multiuser mapping.
- Secure the XML API and restrict it to trusted automation systems; validate all pushed mappings.

## Operations and hygiene

- Keep group membership up to date in directory services so policy stays accurate when users change roles.
- Set reasonable mapping timeouts; too long causes stale identities, too short increases Captive Portal prompts.
- Correlate identity with device context where possible (for example, managed vs. BYOD) for stricter controls on unmanaged devices.

## Troubleshooting checklist

- No identity in logs: check that User-ID is enabled on the zone and server monitoring or syslog parsing is working; confirm time sync.
- Wrong user applied: look for stale mappings; clear or reduce timeout; verify DHCP changes are generating fresh login events.
- Multiple users behind one IP: enable Terminal Server/Citrix mapping or remove that IP from identity-based rules.
- Proxy in path: ensure XFF is preserved and trusted; align policy to use the original client identity/IP.
- VPN users: verify Global Protect portal/gateway auth and that mappings are exported to the firewall enforcing policy.

## Security best practices

- Least privilege: write rules per group/role and add exceptions narrowly, not broadly.
- Defense in depth: combine User-ID with App-ID, URL filtering, and Content scanning; identity alone isn’t a security control.
- Audit trail: log at session end and include user and group fields; periodically review identity-based rule hits.
- Privacy: inform users about identity logging; restrict admin access to user mapping data and audit changes.

## Memory hooks

- Who, not just where: policy looks at user/group in addition to IP/zone.
- Prefer passive sources first; Captive Portal is the fallback.
- Multiuser IPs need port mapping or agent support to avoid misattribution.

## Mini ASCII flow

- Traffic arrives → Is user known for this source IP?
    - Yes → Evaluate policy with user + group context.
    - No → Try passive sources (AD/syslog/GP) → If still unknown, trigger Captive Portal → Then re-evaluate policy.
