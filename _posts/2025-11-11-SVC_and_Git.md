# 📘 Time Travel for Code: Mastering Software Version Control (SVC) and Git

---

## 🧠 What is Software Version Control (SVC)?

**Software Version Control (SVC)** is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. It allows developers to save multiple versions of files, collaborate efficiently, and revert back if issues arise.

Other terms:  
- Revision Control  
- Source Control  
- Part of Software Configuration Management (SCM)

### 🔐 Core Benefits of SVC

| Feature               | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| ✅ Code Protection     | Commits code into a structured history tree. |
| 📜 Change Tracking     | Every change includes metadata (who, what, when). |
| 🤝 Concurrent Work     | Multiple developers can edit simultaneously. |
| ⏪ Rollback            | Revert to any previous version easily. |
| 🌿 Branch & Merge      | Develop features independently and integrate later. |

## 💡 Introducing Git

**Git** is the most popular **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)**.

- 🛠 Created by **Linus Torvalds** in 2005.
- 💡 Free, open-source, highly scalable.
- ⚠️ **Git ≠ GitHub**: Git is the tool. GitHub is a hosting service built on Git.

## 🏗 Git Architecture: Three Main Structures

| Structure       | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| 🧾 Working Directory | Local workspace with source files, docs, etc. |
| 📥 Staging Area (Index) | Temporary holding area for changes before commit. |
| 🧠 Repository (HEAD) | Stores all committed changes locally. |

---

## 🔄 Git File Lifecycle

| Status     | Description | Required Command |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| Untracked  | New file, not tracked by Git | `git add` |
| Unmodified | Tracked, no changes detected | — |
| Modified   | File changed but not staged | `git add` |
| Staged     | Ready to commit | `git commit` |

Check status:  
```bash
git status
```

## 🔧 Essential Git Commands

### 1️⃣ Repository Setup

```bash
git init                # Create a new Git repository
git clone <url>         # Clone existing repository
```

### 2️⃣ Adding, Removing, and Moving Files

```bash
git add .               # Stage all changes
git add <file>          # Stage a specific file

git rm <file>           # Remove file and stage deletion
git rm -rf <folder>     # Force delete folder and stage deletion

git mv <old> <new>      # Rename or move a file
```

---

### 3️⃣ Committing Changes

```bash
git commit -m "message"     # Commit with message
git commit -a -m "message"  # Stage and commit tracked changes
```

---

### 4️⃣ Working with Remotes

```bash
git remote add origin <url>  # Link to remote repository
git remote -v                # Show remotes

git push origin <branch>     # Push changes to remote
git pull origin <branch>     # Pull changes from remote
```

---

### 5️⃣ Branching and Merging

```bash
git branch <branch>          # Create branch
git checkout <branch>        # Switch to branch
git checkout -b <branch>     # Create + switch

git merge <branch>           # Merge into current branch
git branch -d <branch>       # Delete branch
```

#### ⚠️ Conflict Handling

- Git marks conflicting sections.
- Manually edit to resolve.
- Use `git add` and `git commit` to finish conflict resolution.

---

### 6️⃣ History and Comparison

```bash
git log                      # View commit history
git diff                     # Compare working dir with index
git diff --cached            # Compare index with last commit
git diff HEAD                # Compare working dir with last commit
git diff <branch>            # Compare current branch with another
```

---

## 📌 Summary: Git Workflow Steps

```text
1. git init or git clone
2. Edit files
3. git add
4. git commit
5. git push / git pull
6. git branch / git merge (optional)
```
