# 🌐 OSPF Fundamentals

**OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** is a dynamic link-state routing protocol widely used in enterprise networks. It provides fast convergence, hierarchical network design, and scalability, making it ideal for medium to large-scale deployments.

---

## 🔁 OSPF Overview

- **Type**: Link-State Routing Protocol  
- **Administrative Distance (AD)**: 110 (Cisco)  
- **Open Standard**: Supports multivendor environments  

---

## 🧠 OSPF Operation

1. **Link-State Database (LSDB)**: Contains a complete map of the network.  
2. **LSA (Link-State Advertisement)**: Carries route information.  
3. **LSU (Link-State Update)**: Transmits LSAs.  
4. **LSAck**: Acknowledges received LSUs.  

---

## 🧩 OSPF Adjacency & Neighborship

### 🔗 Neighborship Requirements

Routers must match the following parameters to form a neighbor relationship:

1. Area ID  
2. Authentication settings  
3. Subnet  
4. Hello and Dead timers  
5. Stub flag  
6. MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)  

### 🤝 Neighborship Process

- Routers exchange **Hello packets** to form neighborship.  
- Exchange of **DBD (Database Description)** and **LSU** packets establishes **adjacency**.  
- Only **adjacent routers** exchange full routing information.  

---

## 🏆 DR/BDR Election

In broadcast/multi-access networks (e.g., Ethernet), a **Designated Router (DR)** and **Backup Designated Router (BDR)** are elected to reduce overhead.

### 🗳️ Election Process

1. **Router Priority (Highest)**  
   - Default: 1 (carried in Hello packet)  
   - Configuration: `ip ospf priority <number>`  

2. **Router ID (Highest)** (Tie-breaker)  
   - Configuration: `router-id <ID>`  

> Routers with priority `0` are ineligible for DR/BDR election.

### ➕ Why DR/BDR?

Without DR/BDR:
- Number of adjacencies = n(n-1)/2  
- Example: 5 routers → 10 adjacencies

With DR/BDR:
- Each router forms adjacency only with DR and BDR → Reduces overhead

### 📡 Multicast Addresses

- **224.0.0.5** → All OSPF Routers  
- **224.0.0.6** → DR/BDR Only

## 🗺️ OSPF Areas & Design

### 🔄 Hierarchical Design

- **Backbone Area (Area 0)**: Central required area.  
- All other areas must connect to Area 0 (Backbone).

### 🧱 Router Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **AR** | Area Router – exists within a single area |
| **ABR** | Area Border Router – connects multiple areas |
| **ASBR** | Autonomous System Boundary Router – connects to external networks |


## 📈 Scalability

- **Old recommendation** (Router Series 2500): Max 50 routers per area  
- **Current hardware**: Supports **unlimited** routers per area (hardware-dependent)



## 🧮 Dijkstra's Algorithm in OSPF

OSPF uses **Dijkstra’s Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm** to calculate the best paths.

### 🔍 What Is It?

Dijkstra’s algorithm finds the shortest path from the router to all other nodes in the network, building a **Shortest Path Tree (SPT)** using the LSDB.

### ⚙️ How OSPF Uses It:

1. OSPF routers collect **LSAs** from others in the area.  
2. Create the **Link-State Database (LSDB)**.  
3. Run **Dijkstra’s algorithm** on the LSDB to build the SPT.  
4. Update the **routing table** with optimal paths.

### 📌 Why Use It?

- **Fast convergence**  
- **Accurate and loop-free**  
- **Responds quickly to topology changes**
