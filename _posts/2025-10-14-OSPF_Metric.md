<h1 align="center">   üìò OSPF Cost ‚Äì Complete Technical Guide for Interview & Learning</h1>

**Purpose**: This guide is designed for learners, professionals, and interviewers who want a complete and technical understanding of how **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** uses Cost as its routing metric. It includes all important concepts, formulas, configurations, and commands in a structured format for **learning, revision, and reference**.


<h2 align="center">üß† 1. What is OSPF Cost?</h2>


**Definition**:
OSPF Cost is the metric used by OSPF to determine the best (shortest) path to a destination network. **Lower cost = preferred path**.

**Key Points**:

- Every OSPF-enabled interface has an associated cost.

- OSPF uses **cumulative cost**: the total cost of all outgoing interfaces in a path.

- Cost and Metric are used interchangeably (Cost is more commonly used in OSPF).

**Example**:
If a path traverses three links with costs 1, 1, and 2, the total OSPF cost = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.


<h2 align="center">üì° 2. How OSPF Cost is Calculated</h2>


**Formula**:
```bash
OSPF Cost = Reference Bandwidth / Interface Bandwidth
```

üî¢ **Default Reference Bandwidth: `100 Mbps`(100,000,000 bps)**

| Interface Bandwidth | OSPF Cost (Default)                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 10 Mbps             | 100 / 10 = 10                        |
| 100 Mbps            | 100 / 100 = 1                        |
| 1 Gbps              | 100 / 1000 = 0.1 ‚Üí Rounded up to 1   |
| 10 Gbps             | 100 / 10000 = 0.01 ‚Üí Rounded up to 1 |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: OSPF cost values are always integers. Any value < 1 is rounded up to 1.


<h2 align="center">‚ö†Ô∏è 3. Suboptimal Routing with Default Costs</h2>

With the default 100 Mbps reference bandwidth:

- **1 Gbps and 10 Gbps** links get same cost as **100 Mbps: 1**

- Leads to **suboptimal path selection** in modern networks

- **Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP)** issues: OSPF may balance across unequal links

### üîÑ ECMP Behavior:

- OSPF supports up to **4 equal-cost paths** by default

- If unequal links have the same OSPF cost (e.g., 100 Mbps and 10 Gbps), traffic is unevenly balanced.


<h2 align="center">üõ†Ô∏è 4. Manipulating OSPF Cost (Traffic Engineering Techniques)</h2>

### üîß Method 1: Change Reference Bandwidth (***Recommended***)

Use this to make OSPF cost calculations more accurate for high-speed links.
```bash
R1(config-router)# auto-cost reference-bandwidth 10000
```

This sets the reference bandwidth to **10 Gbps**.

**Best Practice**:

- Set same reference bandwidth on **all routers** in the OSPF domain

- Choose a value **equal to or greater than** the fastest link

### ‚öôÔ∏è Method 2: Manually Set OSPF Cost on Interface

Override cost calculation manually.

**Command**:

```bash
R1(config-if)# ip ospf cost 50
```

Use this when:

- You want to influence OSPF route selection manually

- Link speed does not reflect actual link desirability


### üßÆ Method 3: Change Interface Bandwidth Value


Affects the cost indirectly via the formula.

**Command**:

```bash
R1(config-if)# bandwidth 100000
```

**Note**:

- Bandwidth is set in Kbps

- Changing bandwidth affects QoS and other features

- Does not change actual physical speed

| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `show ip ospf interface brief`             | Quick overview: interface cost, state, area, neighbor count |
| `show ip ospf interface [type/number]`     | Detailed interface OSPF data, including exact cost          |
| `show ip ospf database router [router-id]` | Displays LSA Type 1 data and associated metrics in the LSDB |


<h2 align="center">üß¨ 6. Advanced: OSPF Two-Part Metric (RFC 8042)</h2>

**What**: OSPF extension allowing a **two-part metric** in special environments

**Structure**:

1.  **Router-to-Network Cost** (outbound)

2.  **Network-to-Router Cost** (inbound)

**Use Case**:

- Helps in **multi-access/broadcast** environments (e.g., satellite links)

- Reduces LSA update frequency

- Advertised via **Extended Link TLVs** with **Sub-TLVs** in OSPFv2

**Implementation Requirement**:

- All routers in the area must support this extension
