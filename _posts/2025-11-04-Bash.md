# 🧠 The Developer's Command Line: Mastering Linux BASH for Network Automation

> A complete technical overview of BASH for learners, interviewers, and automation engineers.

---

## 📌 Why BASH Matters in Network Automation

For modern network engineers working with **Python**, understanding the **Linux BASH shell** is just as crucial. BASH serves as the interface between the user and the operating system, offering:
- Powerful scripting capabilities
- Efficient environment navigation
- Critical tools for automation and deployment

---

## 🔍 Understanding the BASH Shell

- **BASH** stands for **Bourne Again SHell**
- Default shell on most Linux distros since **1989**
- Lightweight and powerful compared to a full GUI
- Supports: **piping, conditionals, variables, loops**

---

## 📚 Core BASH Concepts

### 📄 Accessing Built-in Documentation
- `man <command>` – View manual pages for any command  
  Example: `man ls`

### 🔐 Running Commands with Elevated Privileges
- `sudo <command>` – Run as superuser  
  Example: `sudo apt update`

### 🔗 Command Chaining with Pipes
- `command1 | command2` – Pipe output of one command into another  
  Example: `cat file.txt | more`

---

## 📁 Navigating the Linux File System

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `cd` | Change directory. `cd /` (root), `cd ..` (up), `cd ~` (home) |
| `pwd` | Print working directory |
| `ls` | List directory contents |
| `ls -a` | Show all files (including hidden) |
| `ls -l` | Long listing with permissions, owners |
| `mkdir <dir>` | Create new directory |

---

## 📂 File Management Commands

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `cp <src> <dest>` | Copy files or directories. Use `-r` for folders |
| `mv <src> <dest>` | Move or rename files/folders |
| `rm <file>` | Remove file. Use `-rf` to force delete directories |
| `touch <file>` | Create empty file or update timestamps |
| `cat <file>` | Show file content or pipe to another command |

---

## 🌍 Managing Environment Variables

### 🔎 Viewing Environment Variables
- `env` – List all environment variables  
- `env | more` – View with pagination

### 💡 Checking a Specific Variable
- `echo $VARIABLE`  
  Example: `echo $PATH`

### 🛠️ Updating a Variable (Temporary)
- `export VAR=value`  
  Example: `export PATH=$PATH:/custom/bin`

### ♻️ Making Permanent Changes
- Edit `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`
- Add: `export PATH=$PATH:/custom/bin`
- Reload: `source ~/.bashrc` or `. ~/.bashrc`

## 🧰 Why Mastering BASH Matters

Mastering BASH enables:
- Efficient file and system management
- Writing automation scripts
- Better debugging and deployment of Python code
- Meeting certification requirements (e.g., **Cisco DEVASC 200-901**)

---

## 📌 Summary for Revision

- Know how to navigate and manipulate the **Linux file system**
- Master **file operations**: copy, move, delete, create
- Learn **pipes**, **redirection**, **variables**, and **permissions**
- Understand **user roles** and **sudo access**
- Be able to **modify environment variables** (temporarily and permanently)

---

🧠 Keep this BASH cheat sheet close as your quick-reference guide in interviews, labs, or while working on network automation scripts.
