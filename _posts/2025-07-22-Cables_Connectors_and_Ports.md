### 1) Foundations and Standards

- Ethernet is a family of standards governing both the **physical layer** (cables, connectors, signaling) and **data link layer** (framing, media access) under **IEEE 802.3** (established in 1983).
- Ethernet is not limited to one medium; it supports both **copper** and **fiber-optic** cabling.
- The IEEE also defines **802.11** for wireless LANs (Wi‑Fi), but that’s distinct from Ethernet.

Interview angles:

- HR: “What is Ethernet?” → A standardized suite for wired networking under IEEE 802.3, covering copper and fiber.
- Technical: “Which IEEE group defines Ethernet?” → IEEE 802.3.

### 2) Data Basics and Units

- **Bit**: Smallest unit of information; binary digit (0 or 1).
- **Byte**: 8 bits.
- Computers compute and communicate in **binary**; all media (apps, photos, audio, video) is represented as 0s and 1s.
- Network speed is measured in **bits per second**:
    - 1 kb = 1,000 bits
    - 1 Mb = 1,000,000 bits
    - 1 Gb = 1,000,000,000 bits
    - 1 Tb = 1,000,000,000,000 bits

Interview angles:

- HR: “What’s the difference between bit and byte?” → 1 byte = 8 bits; network rates in bits/s.
- Technical: “Why do ISPs quote Mbps but files show MB?” → Case sensitivity matters; Mbps vs MBps (divide by 8 for rough conversion).

### 3) Copper Cabling: UTP (and STP)

- Most common “Ethernet cable” is **UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)**.
    - Contains **8 copper conductors**, twisted into **4 pairs** to reduce **EMI** (electromagnetic interference).
    - “Unshielded” means no metallic shield; cheaper and adequate for most office/LAN environments.
- **STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)** exists for high‑EMI environments; less common in typical LANs.
- **Connector**: RJ45, formally **8P8C** (8 positions, 8 contacts).
- Maximum recommended length for copper Ethernet links: **100 meters** (beyond that, expect attenuation and errors).

Interview angles:

- HR: “What connector does Ethernet use?” → RJ45/8P8C.
- Technical: “Why twist the pairs?” → Pair twisting cancels EMI and crosstalk; each pair has a specific twist rate.

---

### 4) Common UTP Ethernet Standards and Categories

- 10 Mbps → **10BASE‑T** → typically **Cat 3**
- 100 Mbps → **100BASE‑T** → typically **Cat 5**
- 1 Gbps → **1000BASE‑T** → typically **Cat 5e**
- 10 Gbps → **10GBASE‑T** → typically **Cat 6a**
- All above have a typical max link length of **100 m** on copper.

Interview angles:

- HR: “What cable category is used for 1 Gbps?” → Cat 5e (or better).
- Technical: “Can Cat 5e do 10G?” → In practice, 10GBASE‑T is specified for Cat 6a for full 100 m; Cat 6 can support shorter 10G runs.

---

### 5) Pair Usage, Pinouts, and Cable Types

- Pair usage by standard:
    - **10BASE‑T**: 2 pairs (4 wires)
    - **100BASE‑T**: 2 pairs (4 wires)
    - **1000BASE‑T**: 4 pairs (8 wires)
    - **10GBASE‑T**: 4 pairs (8 wires)
- In 10/100 Mbps, the active pairs are on **pins 1–2** and **pins 3–6**.
- Cable types:
    - **Straight‑through**: Same pin order on both ends; used for dissimilar devices (host → switch).
    - **Crossover**: Swaps transmit/receive pairs; **pins 1–2 ↔ 3–6**.
- **Auto MDI‑X**: Modern interfaces auto‑detect and adjust TX/RX, making crossover cables largely unnecessary.

Interview angles:

- HR: “What is Auto MDI‑X?” → Automatic transmit/receive pair correction.
- Technical: “When is a crossover cable needed?” → Legacy gear without Auto MDI‑X, or specific lab scenarios.

### 6) Fiber-Optic Cabling

- Transmits **light** through **glass fiber**; immune to EMI, supports far longer distances than copper.
- Must be handled carefully; **sharp bends** can break fiber or cause light leakage and signal loss.
- Typical link uses two fibers: one **transmit** and one **receive**.
- Interfaces use **SFP (Small Form‑Factor Pluggable) transceivers** inserted into SFP ports; transceivers are modular and often a significant cost component.

Types of Fiber:

- **Multimode Fiber (MMF)**
    - Wider core; uses **LED** transmitters.
    - Carries multiple light “modes” (angles) via internal reflection.
    - Typical distance: **hundreds of meters**.
    - Transceivers are cheaper than SMF.
- **Single‑Mode Fiber (SMF)**
    - Very narrow core; uses **laser** transmitters.
    - Single propagation mode, minimal dispersion.
    - Typical distance: **tens of kilometers**.
    - Transceivers are more expensive.

Interview angles:

- HR: “Why pick fiber over copper?” → Longer distance, EMI immunity.
- Technical: “MMF vs SMF?” → LED vs laser, core size, max distance, and cost.

### 7) When to Use UTP vs Fiber

- Choose **UTP (Copper)** when:
    - Connecting end devices (PCs, printers) to access switches.
    - Budget-sensitive deployments where **≤ 100 m** runs suffice.
    - Simpler installation and broad device support.
- Choose **Fiber** when:
    - Interconnecting network devices over longer distances (inter‑floor, inter‑building, campus/WAN).
    - Building high‑speed backbones needing EMI immunity and higher bandwidth.
    - Ready to invest in SFP optics and fiber infrastructure.

Interview angles:

- HR: “Typical use case for fiber?” → Backbone, long‑run links between switches/routers.
- Technical: “What’s the main cost driver for fiber?” → Transceiver optics (SFP/SFP+ modules).

---

### 8) Practical Constraints and Best Practices

- Copper limit: **100 m** end‑to‑end (including patch cords); plan for intermediate switches or convert to fiber if longer.
- For 10/100 Mbps legacy links, remember active pins **1–2** and **3–6**.
- Use **Auto MDI‑X** capable ports to avoid crossover issues; most modern switches have it.
- For fiber, respect **minimum bend radius**, keep connectors clean, and match the optic to the fiber type (MMF vs SMF) and wavelength.

Interview angles:

- HR: “What happens if a copper run exceeds 100 m?” → Attenuation and performance degradation.
- Technical: “Why can a fiber link ‘work’ but show errors?” → Microbends, dirty connectors, mismatched optics, or excessive loss.

---

### 9) Conceptual: Digital vs. Analog and the Modem

- Computers speak **digital** (0/1), but many transmission systems historically carried **analog** signals.
- **Modem** = MOdulator/DEModulator:
    - **Modulation**: digital → analog (for sending over analog mediums).
    - **Demodulation**: analog → digital (for receiving).
- While Ethernet is digital end‑to‑end, understanding modems helps with legacy WANs and telecom interop.

Interview angles:

- HR: “What does a modem do?” → Translates between digital and analog.
- Technical: “Is Ethernet analog or digital?” → Ethernet uses digital signaling; modulation concepts still matter in other media.

### 10) Quick Reference: Common Interview Q&A

- Define Ethernet: IEEE 802.3 wired networking standards (physical + data link).
- Bit vs Byte: 1 byte = 8 bits; network speeds quoted in bits/s.
- Why twisted pairs? Reduce EMI/crosstalk through pair twisting.
- RJ45 vs 8P8C: RJ45 is the common name; 8P8C describes the connector’s physical layout.
- Max copper length: 100 m.
- Straight‑through vs crossover: Straight for unlike devices; crossover swaps TX/RX—mostly obsolete with Auto MDI‑X.
- 1000BASE‑T wire usage: All 4 pairs (8 wires).
- Fiber choices: MMF (LED, hundreds of meters) vs SMF (laser, tens of km).
- Why fiber for backbones? Longer distance, higher bandwidth, EMI immunity.
- Cost drivers: For fiber, SFP/SFP+ transceivers are a major cost component.

### 11) Troubleshooting Tips

- Copper:
    - Check total channel length ≤ 100 m.
    - Verify cable category matches speed (e.g., 10G needs Cat 6a for 100 m).
    - Inspect termination quality and pinout consistency.
- Fiber:
    - Clean connectors; inspect with scope if available.
    - Check bend radius and route.
    - Ensure optic type, wavelength, and fiber type match.
    - Validate link budget (loss) with proper testing.
