## Network Devices

### 1. What is a Network?

- A **computer network** is a telecommunications network that allows **nodes to share resources**.
- **LAN (Local Area Network):** Group of interconnected devices in a limited area (office, campus).
- **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Extends over large geographical areas (cities, countries).
- **Node:** Any device connected to a network (PC, iPhone, router, etc.).
- **Resource:** Anything that can be accessed/used over the network.

### 2. Network Devices

### **Client & Server**

- **Client:** A device that accesses a service provided by a server.
- **Server:** A device that provides services for clients.
- Client & server nodes are often called **endpoints / end hosts**.

---

### **Hub**

- **Definition:** Simple device to connect multiple devices in a LAN.
- **Function:** Broadcasts incoming data to all ports.
- **Limitation:** Causes unnecessary traffic â†’ rarely used in modern networks.
- **Layer:** OSI Layer 1 (Physical).

---

### **Switch**

- **Definition:** Switches provide connectivity between devices in a LAN.
- Typically have **24â€“48 ports** for end hosts (PCs, printers, servers, cameras).
- **Function:** Forwards data only to intended recipient using **MAC addresses**.
- **Layer:** OSI Layer 2 (Data Link).
- **Note:** A port is a physical connector on a device (used interchangeably with interface).

{ â‡’ Devices connected to a switch are able to communicate with each other via the switch. Note that they do not typically communicate with the switch itselfâ€”the switch only serves as infrastructure over which communication can occur.

The role of a switch is to connect devices within a LAN. For example, all of the PCs, security cameras, printers, servers, and other devices in an office are probably connected to one or more switches. For this reason, itâ€™s common for switches to have many ports for end hosts to connect toâ€”usually from 24 to 48 per switch.

NOTE A port is a physical connector on a device. Devices are physically connected by connecting one end of a cable to each of two devices. A port serves as the interface between one device and the other devices in the network. For that reason, the terms port and interface are often used interchangeably. }

### **Router**

- **Definition:** Routers provide connectivity between LANs and external networks (e.g., Internet).
- **Function:** Forwards packets between networks based on **IP addresses**.
- **Layer:** OSI Layer 3 (Network).

**Wireless Routers (SOHO):**

> A wireless router (Wi-Fi router/home router) is not just a router; itâ€™s a multifunctional device combining router + switch + wireless access point + firewall.
> 
> 
> Common in **small office/home office (SOHO)**, but enterprises use separate dedicated devices.

### **Firewall**

- **Definition:** Firewalls secure the network by inspecting traffic entering/exiting and allowing/denying based on rules.

**Types:**

- **Host-based Firewall** â†’ Software firewall (e.g., Windows Defender). Works on a single device.
- **Network Firewall** â†’ Dedicated hardware. Protects entire network by filtering all inbound/outbound traffic.

---

### **Wireless Access Point (AP)**

- **Role:** Connect wireless devices to wired network.
- **Function:** Provides **WLAN (Wi-Fi)** connectivity.
- **Layer:** OSI Layer 2.

---

### **Modem**

- **Definition:** Converts digital data â†” analog signals for transmission over phone/cable lines.
- **Use:** DSL, cable, or dial-up internet.

---

### **Repeater**

- **Definition:** A repeater regenerates/amplifies signals to extend travel distance.
- **Function:** Prevents signal degradation across long distances.
- **Use Case:** Extend Ethernet or Wi-Fi.
- **Layer:** OSI Layer 1.

---

### **Bridge**

- **Definition:** A bridge connects and filters traffic between two network segments, making them function as one.
- **Function:** Creates separate **collision domains**, reduces unnecessary traffic.
- **Layer:** OSI Layer 2.
- **Use:** Break down large networks into smaller, manageable sections.

---

### **Gateway**

- **Definition:** A gateway acts as an entry/exit point between different networks, often operating at multiple OSI layers.
- **Function:** Protocol/format conversion (e.g., TCP/IP â†” AppleTalk).
- **Use:** LAN-to-Internet, or between different architectures.
- **Note:** Routers often integrate gateway functions.

---

### **WLC (Wireless LAN Controller)**

- **Definition:** Used to manage multiple access points.
- **Function:** Centralized control, configuration, and monitoring of Wi-Fi networks.

---

### 3. Network Topologies

- **Definition:** Topology = physical or logical arrangement of devices and connections.

**Types:**

- **Bus:** Single line, one failure = full outage.
- **Star:** All devices connect to central hub/switch; hub failure = outage.
- **Ring:** Devices in circular chain; data passes device-to-device.
- **Mesh:** Devices fully interconnected; very reliable but costly.

---

### 4. Network Interface Card (NIC)

- **Definition:** Hardware inside end devices enabling network connectivity.
- **Types:** Wired (Ethernet), Wireless (Wi-Fi).
- **Each NIC has a unique MAC address.**
- May be integrated into motherboard or add-on card.

---

### 5. Message Delivery Types

- **Unicast:** One-to-one transmission.
- **Broadcast:** One-to-all in a broadcast domain (routers block broadcasts by default).
- **Multicast:** One-to-many group communication; efficient bandwidth use.
- **Protocols:** IGMP (IPv4), MLD (IPv6).

### 6. Quick Command Reference (Windows CMD)

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ping` | Check reachability (ICMP). |
| `ipconfig` | Show IP address. |
| `ipconfig /all` | Show IP + MAC + full details. |
| `getmac` | Show MAC address only. |
| `netstat` | Show active connections/sessions. |
| `nslookup` | Query DNS records for a website. |
| `arp -a` | Show ARP table (IP-to-MAC mapping). |
| `arp -d` | Clear ARP table (Admin mode). |
