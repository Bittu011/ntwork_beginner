## Why EIGRP matters

- SupportsÂ **unequal-cost load balancing**Â using the variance feature, unlike most IGPs, allowing efficient use of diverse links.
- Converges rapidly by leveraging theÂ **Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL)**Â and precomputed loopâ€‘free backups called feasible successors.

## Core algorithm: DUAL

- **DUAL**Â tracks route states, calculates best paths, and coordinates queries/replies to ensure loop-free convergence during changes.
- If a successor fails and a feasible successor exists, the route switches instantly without running a full diffusion, minimizing downtime.

## Key tables

- **Neighbor table**Â holds directly connected EIGRP peers discovered via Hellos;Â **topology table**Â stores all learned routes with their metrics and candidates;Â **routing table**Â installs only chosen successors (and additional paths per variance).
- The topology table is DUALâ€™s workspace, tracking each destinationâ€™s successors, feasible successors, and metrics for rapid failover.

## Distances and metrics

- **Reported/Advertised Distance (RD/AD):**Â the metric a neighbor claims to the destination.
- **Feasible Distance (FD):**Â the local total metric to the destination via a given neighbor; the lowest FD determines the successor and is used for variance calculations.

## Fast convergence behavior

- With an FS present, convergence is instantaneous upon successor loss; without an FS, DUAL diffuses queries to find a new loopâ€‘free path.
- Triggers for DUAL include successor loss without an FS, topology changes, or received queries that necessitate recomputation.

## Blog-ready definitions

- **DUAL:**Â Loop-free route computation and rapid reconvergence engine for EIGRP.
- **Variance:**Â Multiplier to allow unequal-cost load balancing by admitting additional FS paths whose FD is within the threshold.
- **Successor route:**Â The path A â†’ B â†’ X with the lowest cost.
- **Successor:**Â Router B (next-hop from A).
- **Feasible Distance:**Â Total cost from A to X via B.
- **Reported Distance:**Â Cost from B to X (reported by B).
- **Feasibility condition:**Â Is the cost from B to X (RD) less than A's own best total cost to X (FD)?
- **Feasible successor:**Â Say Router C reports a path to X with RD < Aâ€™s FDâ€”A can keep C as a backup route to X.

## Multiple processes

- A single router can run several EIGRP processes simultaneously; each process is scoped to anÂ **AS number**Â and maintains its own neighbor, topology, and routing tables.
- Processes in different ASNs do not share routes by default; they behave as separate routing domains unless redistribution is configured.

## Autonomous systems

- An EIGRPÂ **autonomous system**Â is a common routing domain for routers that share metrics and exchange updates; do not confuse it with an Internet BGP AS.
- Routers must use the same EIGRP ASN to form adjacencies; the ASN is configured with router eigrp ASN in classic mode or under address-family in named mode.

## Route transfer between ASNs

- EIGRP does not automatically move prefixes across different EIGRP ASNs; implementÂ **redistribution**Â between processes to leak or share routes intentionally.
- When redistributing, plan summarization and filtering to avoid accidental leaks or suboptimal paths, similar in spirit to controlling leaks in other protocols.

## Protocol-dependent modules (PDMs)

- **PDMs**Â give EIGRP multiprotocol capability; each PDM handles send/receive, DUAL notifications, and installing routes for its specific protocol.
- Current implementations focus onÂ **IPv4 and IPv6**Â PDMs, while historic PDMs included AppleTalk and IPX.

EIGRP maintains a dedicated topology table per AS/address family that DUAL uses to compute loop-free successors and feasible successors for rapid convergence.

## What it stores

- The table lists every known destination prefix within the EIGRP domain along with next-hop candidates learned from neighbors.
- For each prefix, it records the neighbors that advertised it, their reported/advertised distance, and hop count metadata.
- It also retains per-path metric components used in EIGRPâ€™s composite metric: minimum bandwidth, cumulative delay, and optionally load and reliability.

## Why itâ€™s different

- Unlike pure distance-vector protocols, EIGRPâ€™s topology table lets DUAL precompute loop-free alternates, enabling immediate failover when a successor fails.
- Only the best path (successor) is installed in the routing table by default; backups remain in the topology table unless features like FRR preinstall them.

EIGRP uses its own Reliable Transport Protocol (RTP) over IP protocol number 88 to deliver routing messages, multicasting to 224.0.0.10 (MAC 01:00:5E:00:00:0A) when possible and unicasting when reliability demands it.

## Neighbor adjacencies

- Neighbors are discovered with periodic Hello packets and tracked in the adjacency table; full topology exchange occurs only when the adjacency forms, after which only incremental updates are sent.
- Loss of acknowledgments or missed Hellos triggers recovery: EIGRP may shift from multicast to unicast per-neighbor and can reset the adjacency after retry limits.

## Packet types

- Hello: used for discovery and liveliness detection; sent unreliably via multicast, no ACK required.
- Update: carries routing and reachability; sent reliably via multicast or unicast depending on scope.
- Query: asks neighbors for alternate paths during convergence; sent reliably, typically multicast.
- Reply: response to a Query; sent reliably via unicast.
- ACK: acknowledgment of reliable packets; always unicast and itself does not require acknowledgment.

## Multicast details

- Default IPv4 multicast group for EIGRP control traffic is 224.0.0.10, which maps on Ethernet to MAC 01-00-5E-00-00-0A; only hosts joined to this group process the frames.
- Routers fall back to unicast when a neighbor fails to acknowledge reliable multicasts, preventing unnecessary retransmissions to other neighbors

## RTP reliability mechanics

- Every reliable EIGRP packet carries a nonzero sequence number; the receiver must return an ACK echoing that sequence for ordered delivery.
- If ACKs are not received before the retransmission timeout (RTO) derived from SRTT, EIGRP retransmits; after up to 16 retries, the neighbor is reset.

EIGRP forms a neighbor adjacency before installing routes in the RIB; on receiving Hellos, routers attempt to peer but only succeed when key parameters match.

## Must-match parameters

- Metric formulaÂ **K values**Â must be identical on both routers; any mismatch prevents adjacency and should be changed consistently AS-wide.
- The interfacesâ€™Â **primary IP subnets**Â must match; if one side uses a different primary network (even with a matching secondary), neighbors do not form.
- TheÂ **Autonomous System Number (ASN)**Â for the EIGRP process/address-family must be the same on both peers.
- **Authentication settings**Â (mode and keys) must match across neighbors if enabled.
