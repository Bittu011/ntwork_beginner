# 🌐 Building an OSPF Enterprise Lab: Hands-on Networking for Real-World Engineers

*By Ntwork Beginner*

---

## 🚀 Introduction

Curious about how large companies design reliable, scalable networks?  
Let’s go behind the scenes of my **hands-on Cisco OSPF lab project**—built to model real enterprise networks, and to boost my practical networking chops!

## 🗺️ Lab Topology Overview

My recent lab project focuses on OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), NAT, multiple routing areas, and redundancy—all using a network design you might find in enterprise settings.

Here’s the core design:

- **Area 0 (Backbone):** Core router connecting to the Internet, and bridging the edge areas.
- **Area 1 & Area 2:** Edge areas with their own routers and PCs, linked through Area 0.
- **NAT:** For secure Internet access.
- **Loopbacks & PCs:** For end device simulation.

**Visual Topology:**

## 🔧 What Did I Build?

**Routers, areas, and more:**
- **OSPF area design:** Area 0 (core), connecting two other areas
- **Router connections:** Core router links both edges, promoting hierarchy and scalability
- **End devices:** PCs connected via access routers
- **Internet link:** NAT implemented on the core router for Internet access

### Key Roles:
- **R1:** The Core—links everything; handles NAT/gateway functions.
- **R2/R3 (Area 1), R4/R5 (Area 2):** Edge and access routers for clients/PCs.
- **D1/D2:** Simulated PCs on edge networks.

## ✨ Why Build This Lab?

- **Learn OSPF Areas:** Real companies segment their networks for performance and security. OSPF is the gold standard.
- **Experience NAT:** Understand how private networks get to the Internet—safely.
- **Redundancy and Scalability:** Discover how backbone areas keep everything connected and resilient.
- **End-to-End Practice:** From Internet access to device isolation—see it all in action.

## 🛠️ Behind the Scenes: My Config Steps

1. **Configured OSPF on all routers**
2. **Assigned interfaces to correct OSPF areas**
3. **Set up NAT on R1 for private-to-public access**
4. **Tested end-to-end connectivity (PC to Internet)**
5. **Verified area segmentation and failover**
