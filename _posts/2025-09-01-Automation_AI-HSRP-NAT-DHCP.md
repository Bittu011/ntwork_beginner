# 🤖 AI-Driven Network Automation: Cisco CML Lab with HSRP, NAT & DHCP

*By [Ntwork Beginner]*

---

## 🚀 Introduction

In modern enterprise networks, **automation and AI** are game-changers for managing complexity, boosting efficiency, and reducing errors.  
My latest Cisco Modeling Labs (CML) project brings these together:  
**traditional resiliency (HSRP, NAT, DHCP)** meets **AI-powered automation** for a truly future-ready lab!

## 🔑 Key Lab Components

- **Dual ISPs (ISP1 & ISP2):** Reliable, redundant Internet uplink.
- **Routers (R1 & R2):**  
  - HSRP for virtual IP failover.  
  - NAT for secure Internet access.  
  - AI-driven configuration scripting for zero-touch deployment.
- **Switches & PCs:**  
  - End-user LANs with plug-and-play DHCP via automation.
- **Automation With AI:**  
  - Auto-generates device configs, applies changes in bulk, and even diagnoses misconfigurations!

## ⚙️ How AI Automation Works Here

- **Automated Provisioning:** Use AI scripts (Python, Ansible, etc.) to generate and deploy configs for routers and switches (HSRP, NAT, DHCP) instantly.
- **Error Prediction & Correction:** AI tools detect common config mistakes and suggest optimal settings—great for both learners and busy engineers.
- **Smart Rollbacks:** If something breaks, AI-powered checks can instantly revert to a stable config snapshot.
- **DHCP/NAT/HSRP Scripts:** No typing commands by hand—tools write, validate, and push configs reliably.
