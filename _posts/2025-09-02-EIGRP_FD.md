<h1 align="center">🧭 EIGRP Feasibility Condition (FC): The Secret Behind Loop-Free Routing</h1>


EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) is famous for its **lightning-fast convergence** — recovering from network failures faster than most other IGPs.
The magic behind this speed is the **Feasibility Condition (FC)** — a core concept derived from EIGRP’s **Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL)**.


The FC ensures loop-free paths, pre-computed backups, and near-instant convergence when primary links fail.


<h2 align="center">🔹 Part 1: Understanding the DUAL Terminology</h2>


Before diving into the Feasibility Condition, let’s define EIGRP’s fundamental components — all stored in the **Topology Table**.


| Term                        | Easy Definition                                               | Technical Definition                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Feasible Distance (FD)**  | The best total metric currently known to reach a destination. | The lowest known total metric to a destination since the last ACTIVE → PASSIVE transition. |
| **Reported Distance (RD)**  | The metric advertised by a neighbor toward the destination.   | The neighbor’s advertised distance to reach that network, shared in routing updates.       |
| **Successor**               | The best path used for actual traffic forwarding.             | The neighbor that provides the **lowest-cost path** and meets the Feasibility Condition.   |
| **Feasible Successor (FS)** | A pre-computed backup route that’s guaranteed loop-free.      | A backup route that satisfies the Feasibility Condition (RD < FD).                         |



<h2 align="center">🔹 Part 2: The Feasibility Condition Rule</h2>


The **Feasibility Condition** decides whether a potential route is **loop-free** and eligible to become a **Feasible Successor**.


**✅ The Golden Rule:**

                Reported Distance (RD)<Feasible Distance (FD)

If this condition holds true, the neighbor’s path is **guaranteed loop-free** and stored as a Feasible Successor.


<h2 align="center">🧩 Why RD < FD Prevents Loops</h2>


Let’s visualize:


```bash
Destination Network (10.1.1.0/24)
        |
      [R3]
       | RD = 100
      [R2]
       | RD = 200 <--- R1’s FD = 300
      [R1]
```


**Explanation:**

-   R1’s best known total cost (FD) to the destination = 300
-   R2 advertises its distance (RD) = 200
-   Since RD (200) < FD (300), R2 is closer to the destination than R1
-   Hence, R2 cannot route traffic back to R1 — ensuring a loop-free path

If instead:

RD>FD


That means the neighbor (R2) might be upstream and could potentially send traffic back toward R1, forming a **routing loop**.


Thus, EIGRP never considers such a path as a valid backup.


<h2 align="🔹 Part 3: The DUAL Algorithm in Action"></h2>


EIGRP’s **DUAL (Diffusing Update Algorithm)** maintains three key data structures:


```bash
+---------------------------------------+
|             EIGRP Tables              |
+---------------------------------------+
| Neighbor Table   → List of neighbors  |
| Topology Table   → All known routes   |
| Routing Table    → Best route only    |
+---------------------------------------+
```

-   **Successor** → Best path (active route in RIB)
-   **Feasible Successor** → Backup route (pre-validated by FC)


DUAL constantly checks FC and precomputes backup paths — allowing **instant failover** if the primary link fails.


<h2 align="center">🔹 Part 4: Practical Benefits of the Feasibility Condition</h2>



<h3>1️⃣ Fast Convergence</h3>


If the **primary route fails**, EIGRP checks if a Feasible Successor exists.

-   **If FS exists:**
    -    Instant switchover — no queries or route recalculations.
         Route stays in PASSIVE state.

-   **If FS doesn’t exist:**
    -   Route becomes ACTIVE → router sends Queries to neighbors → waits for replies → slower convergence.


```bash
+-------------------+       +-------------------+
| Primary Route Down| --->  | FS Exists?        |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+
           |                          |
        YES ↓                      NO ↓
  Instantly Switch          Send Queries → Active State
```


<h3>2️⃣ Unequal-Cost Load Balancing</h3>


Unlike OSPF or RIP, EIGRP supports unequal-cost load balancing using the `variance` command.

If the **Feasible Successor’s FD** is within the **variance multiplier** of the successor’s FD, it can also be installed in the routing table:


                         FS FD≤Successor FD×Variance


This allows EIGRP to **load-balance across multiple paths of different costs** — all guaranteed to be loop-free because of the Feasibility Condition.


**Example:**

```bash
Successor FD = 1000
Variance = 2
Feasible Successor FD = 1800  → (1800 ≤ 1000×2) ✅ Eligible for Load Balancing
```


<h2 align="center">🔹 Part 5: Summary and Key Takeaways</h2>


| Concept                                  | Description                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Feasibility Condition (RD < FD)**      | Ensures all backup routes are **loop-free**           |
| **Successor**                            | Primary path to destination                           |
| **Feasible Successor (FS)**              | Pre-verified loop-free backup                         |
| **DUAL Algorithm**                       | Core logic maintaining stability and fast convergence |
| **No Queries if FS Exists**              | Enables **instant failover**                          |
| **Supports Unequal-Cost Load Balancing** | Adds **efficiency + redundancy**                      |


<h2 align="center">🧠 Interview & Exam Quick Facts</h2>


-   **Formula**: RD < FD
-   **Purpose**: Loop prevention in EIGRP
-   **Stored In**: Topology Table
-   **Active vs Passive**:
    -   Passive → Stable, converged state
    -   Active → Searching for new path
-   **Variance Command**: Enables unequal-cost load balancing
-   **Feasible Successor**: Pre-calculated backup route
-   **If FC Fails**: Route not used (potential loop risk)



<h2 align="center">💬 Analogy: The Downstream Neighbor Concept</h2>


Think of routers as **delivery partners**:

-   R1 = You (dispatch center)
-   R2 = Neighbor (closer delivery hub)
-   Destination = Customer location


If R2 says: “I’m **closer to the customer** than you are,” (RD < FD), you can safely hand the package to R2 — it won’t come back.

If R2 says it’s **farther**, you don’t trust it — it might just route the package back to you (loop).


<h2 align="center">🧩 Final Thoughts</h2>


The **Feasibility Condition (RD < FD)** is **the backbone of EIGRP’s reliability** — it’s what gives DUAL its speed, loop-free nature, and scalability.

By mastering FC, you understand not just **why EIGRP converges fast**, but **how it guarantees stability** — even in the most dynamic networks.
