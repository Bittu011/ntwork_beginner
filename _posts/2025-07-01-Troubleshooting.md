# Troubleshooting Steps for a Network Engineer

## Step 1. Identify the Problem  
**Goal:** Gather all necessary information to understand the issue clearly.  

**Actions:**  
- Talk to the user and collect details: **Name, Location, Building, Floor, IP Address**.  
- Ask clarifying questions:  
  - *What happens when you click X, then Y?*  
  - *Is this issue only for you or are others affected as well?*  
  - *Have you faced this issue earlier?*  
- Perform quick checks:  
  - Try changing to another computer.  
  - Compare with a neighborâ€™s computer (IP, connectivity).  
- Note symptoms: **Is it connectivity, speed, application, or hardware-related?**  

---

## Step 2. Establish a Theory of Probable Causes  
**Goal:** Narrow down possible reasons for the issue.  

**Actions:**  
- Consider all potential causes (e.g., cabling, switch port, IP conflict, DNS, firewall, routing issue).  
- Check logs, error messages, and user reports.  
- Use initial tools: **ping, traceroute, ipconfig/ifconfig, switchport status**.  
- Create a list of **likely suspects**.  

---

## Step 3. Test the Theory to Determine Cause  
**Goal:** Validate which probable cause is the actual root cause.  

**Actions:**  
- Apply a **quick fix** (e.g., renew IP, restart NIC, move cable to another port).  
- Test each theory one by one to see if it solves the problem.  
- If unsuccessful:  
  - Research deeper (logs, vendor documentation, knowledge base).  
  - Escalate if necessary with supporting evidence.  

---

## Step 4. Establish a Plan of Action and Implement the Solution  
**Goal:** Fix the issue without causing further disruption.  

**Actions:**  
- Choose the **most effective and least disruptive fix**.  
- If downtime is required, communicate with stakeholders.  
- Apply the fix methodically (e.g., replace cable, configure switchport, update routing, reset device).  
- Monitor during implementation.  

---

## Step 5. Verify Solution and Implement Preventive Measures  
**Goal:** Ensure issue is resolved and wonâ€™t reoccur.  

**Actions:**  
- Confirm with the user: **Is functionality fully restored?**  
- Run end-to-end connectivity tests.  
- Monitor the affected network segment.  
- If possible, apply preventive measures (e.g., update configs, patch system, improve monitoring alerts).  

---

## Step 6. Document Findings, Actions, and Outcomes  
**Goal:** Build a record for future troubleshooting.  

**Actions:**  
- Record:  
  - Problem symptoms.  
  - Root cause.  
  - Steps taken to resolve.  
  - Final outcome.  
- Update internal knowledge base or ticketing system.  
- Share insights with team for training and future prevention.
