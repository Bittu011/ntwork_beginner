# üõ£Ô∏è Routing Fundamentals ‚Äì A Technical Guide for Beginners and CCNA Aspirants

Routing is one of the foundational concepts in networking that enables communication between devices across different networks. Whether you‚Äôre a networking student, a CCNA aspirant, or just brushing up on your basics, understanding routing is key to mastering how data moves in the digital world.

This guide breaks down routing fundamentals in a clean, technical, and interview-focused manner to make your learning or revision as effective as possible.

## üîç What Is Routing?

Routing involves two major tasks:

1. **Forwarding Packets** ‚Äì Moving data packets from one network to another.
2. **Building and Using a Routing Table** ‚Äì Determining the best path to reach a destination IP address.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è How Hosts Send Packets

### üìç Local Network Communication

- If two devices are on the same network, they communicate **directly** using MAC addresses.
- The sender checks the destination IP. If it's within the same subnet, it sends the packet directly, using ARP to resolve the MAC address.

### üåê Remote Network Communication

- If the destination IP is **outside the local network**, the host sends the packet to its **default gateway** (a router).
- The packet is encapsulated in a frame with the **default gateway's MAC address** as the destination.
- The default gateway can be:
  - **Manually configured**, or
  - **Dynamically assigned** via **DHCP**.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Command to check on Windows:

```bash
ipconfig
```

> Displays your IP, subnet mask, and default gateway.

## üì° Routing from the Router‚Äôs Perspective

### 1. Frame Reception

- The router checks the **MAC address** in the incoming frame.

- If it's addressed to the router, it de-encapsulates the frame and reads the IP packet.

### 2. Routing Table Lookup
- The router checks the **destination IP address**.

- It looks up the **most specific matching route** (longest prefix match) in its **routing table**.

### 3. Forwarding the Packet

- **Route Found**: The router encapsulates the packet in a new frame and forwards it to the next hop.

- **Route Not Found**: If no match and no default route exists, the packet is dropped.

```bash
show ip route

### Types of Routes:

| Type                | Code | Description                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Connected Route** | C    | Auto-added when an interface is up/up. Route to the connected **network**.     |
| **Local Route**     | L    | Auto-added. Route to the router's own IP (/32). For packets **to the router**. |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è A router does not forward packets to its local IP ‚Äî it processes them locally.


## üß† Route Selection Logic

- Most specific match wins (longest prefix length).

### Example:
| Prefix | Specificity                    |
| ------ | ------------------------------ |
| /32    | Most specific (single host)    |
| /24    | Less specific                  |
| /0     | Least specific (default route) |

### Layer 2 vs Layer 3

| Layer | Device | Lookup Type                       |
| ----- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| L2    | Switch | Exact **MAC address** match       |
| L3    | Router | Longest prefix match (IP address) |


## üîß Static Routing

When routers need to reach networks that aren't directly connected, routes can be:

- Dynamically learned (e.g., OSPF, EIGRP)

- Manually configured (Static Routing)

### Static Route Command:
```bash
ip route <destination-network> <netmask> {next-hop | exit-interface | exit-interface next-hop}
```
### üîç Types of Static Routes

| Type                       | Syntax                                               | Description                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Recursive Static Route** | `ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1`        | Uses **next-hop IP**. Requires recursive lookup to find exit interface.           |
| **Directly Connected**     | `ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 Gig0/0`          | Uses **interface only**. Relies on **Proxy ARP**. Not recommended.                |
| **Fully Specified Route**  | `ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 Gig0/0 10.0.0.1` | Specifies both next-hop IP and interface. **Most efficient** and **recommended**. |

## üåç Default Route ‚Äì The Gateway of Last Resort

A **default route** is used when there‚Äôs no specific match in the routing table.

**Configuration:**

```bash
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 {next-hop | exit-interface | exit-interface next-hop}
```

### Key Points:

- Matches all IPs (0.0.0.0/0).

- Often points to the ISP router for internet access.

- If not set, unmatched packets are dropped.

### Check default route:

```bash
show ip route
```

### If not configured:
```bash
Gateway of last resort is not set
```

### Once configured:
```bash
Gateway of last resort is 192.168.1.1 to network 0.0.0.0
```

## üìù Interview & CCNA Exam Tips
### Know Route Codes:

| Code | Meaning                  |
| ---- | ------------------------ |
| C    | Connected route          |
| L    | Local route              |
| S    | Static route             |
| S\*  | Static **default** route |


### Common Tasks You Should Practice:

- Identifying route types.

- Configuring static routes.

- Matching route commands to route types.

- Understanding how route selection works.

- Explaining Proxy ARP scenarios.

- Reading and analyzing ```show ip route``` outputs.
