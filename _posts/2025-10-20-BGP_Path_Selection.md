# üß≠ BGP Path Selection ‚Äì Complete Technical Notes

**For Interviewers, Learners, and Network Engineers**

---

## I. Beginner Level ‚Äì Core Concepts & Attributes

### üìò What is BGP Path Selection?

BGP (**Border Gateway Protocol**) is an *Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP)* used to exchange routing information between Autonomous Systems (AS).  
Unlike OSPF or EIGRP, BGP is **policy-based**, not **metric-based** ‚Äî it uses multiple path attributes for decision-making.

---

### üéØ Key Objectives of BGP Path Selection

BGP determines the best route using these **five primary attributes**:

| # | Attribute | Description |
|---|------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Weight** | Cisco proprietary; higher value preferred |
| 2 | **Local Preference** | Influences routing within the AS; higher preferred |
| 3 | **AS Path** | Fewer AS hops preferred |
| 4 | **Origin** | Route source indicator; IGP > Incomplete |
| 5 | **MED (Multi-Exit Discriminator)** | Lower value preferred |

### üß† Mnemonic for Attribute Order

> **‚ÄúWe Love Oranges As Oranges Mean Pure Refreshments‚Äù**

| Mnemonic | Attribute | Preference |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| We | Weight | Higher is better |
| Love | Local Preference | Higher is better |
| Oranges | Originated Locally | Locally originated routes preferred |
| As | AS Path | Shorter is better |
| Oranges | Origin Code | IGP (i) > Incomplete (?) |
| Mean | MED | Lower is better |
| Pure | Path Type | eBGP > iBGP |
| Refreshments | Router ID | Lower is better |

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Attribute Highlights

| Attribute | Type | Scope | Default | Notes |
|------------|------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Weight** | Cisco proprietary | Local to router | 0 (learned), 32768 (local) | Not advertised to peers |
| **Local Preference** | Well-known discretionary | Entire AS | 100 | Shared within iBGP peers |
| **AS Path** | Well-known mandatory | Global | ‚Äî | Counts AS hops |
| **Origin Code** | Well-known mandatory | Global | ‚Äî | `i` (IGP) > `?` (Incomplete) |
| **MED** | Optional non-transitive | Between ASes | ‚Äî | Lower preferred, not passed beyond neighbor AS |

---

## II. Intermediate to Advanced Level ‚Äì Technical Criteria & Configuration

### üîñ A. BGP Attribute Classification

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **Well-Known Mandatory** | Must exist in all updates, understood by all vendors | AS Path, Origin |
| **Well-Known Discretionary** | Understood by all vendors, may not appear | Local Preference |
| **Optional Transitive** | May not be understood, but carried across ASes | Communities |
| **Optional Non-Transitive** | Not understood or carried beyond neighbor AS | MED, Weight (Cisco) |

### ‚ö° B. Full BGP Path Selection Criteria (Top‚ÄìDown)

BGP always follows the same decision order.  
If a tie occurs at one level, it continues to the next.

| Step | Criteria | Preference Rule |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Next-Hop Reachability** | Must be reachable |
| 2 | **Highest Weight** | Higher wins |
| 3 | **Highest Local Preference** | Higher wins |
| 4 | **Locally Originated Route** | Prefer self-originated |
| 5 | **Shortest AS Path** | Fewer AS hops preferred |
| 6 | **Lowest Origin Code** | IGP (i) > Incomplete (?) |
| 7 | **Lowest MED** | Lower wins |
| 8 | **eBGP over iBGP** | External routes preferred |
| 9 | **Lowest IGP Metric to Next Hop** | Lower metric preferred |
| 10 | **Oldest Path** | More stable route preferred |
| 11 | **Lowest BGP Router ID** | Smaller ID preferred |
| 12 | **Shortest Cluster List** | Used with Route Reflectors |
| 13 | **Lowest Neighbor IP** | Used as final tiebreaker |

---

### üß© C. Configuration & Attribute Manipulation Rules

Attributes are applied in the **direction of control-plane updates**.

| Attribute | Direction | Scope / Impact | Example Command |
|------------|------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Weight** | Inbound only | Local router only | `set weight 1000` |
| **Local Preference** | Inbound from eBGP / Outbound to iBGP | Entire AS | `set local-preference 200` |
| **AS Path** | Inbound / Outbound | Makes path appear longer | `set as-path prepend 100 100 100` |
| **Origin** | Inbound / Outbound | Affects route preference | `set origin incomplete` |
| **MED** | Outbound to eBGP | Affects neighbor‚Äôs path selection | `set metric 50` |

---

### üß± D. Configuration Differences ‚Äì Cisco IOS XE vs IOS XR

| Platform | Policy Mechanism | Matching Method | Implicit Deny Behavior | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|------------------------|-------|
| **Cisco IOS XE (XZ)** | Route Map | `match ip address <ACL>` | Must include a final `permit` for unmatched routes | Common in classic IOS/IOS-XE |
| **Cisco IOS XR (XR)** | Route Policy (RPL) | `if destination in <prefix-set>` | Must include `else pass` | Modular and reusable |
| **XR eBGP Default** | ‚Äî | ‚Äî | Routes blocked unless explicit `pass` | Policy required for eBGP peers |

---

### üßÆ BGP Path Manipulation Summary

| Scenario | Attribute to Tune | Direction | Use Case |
|-----------|------------------|------------|-----------|
| Prefer local exit within AS | Local Preference | Inbound | Internal traffic control |
| Prefer one ISP over another | Weight | Inbound | Local outbound path selection |
| Make path less preferred | AS Path Prepend | Outbound | Influence inbound traffic |
| Influence neighbor‚Äôs choice | MED | Outbound | Encourage entry via certain link |
| Modify origin type | Origin | Outbound | Adjust route preference |

---

### üß† Real-World Key Points

- **Weight** ‚Äì Local-only, not shared.  
- **Local Preference** ‚Äì Shared within AS via iBGP.  
- **AS Path Prepending** ‚Äì Used to influence *inbound* traffic.  
- **MED** ‚Äì Only applies between directly connected ASes.  
- **eBGP > iBGP** ‚Äì Always preferred when all else is equal.  
- **Router ID** ‚Äì Final tie-breaker.
